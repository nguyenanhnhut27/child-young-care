3. Click "Process Documents"
4. Now the AI will reference YOUR materials in responses!

### 3. Generate Study Notes
1. Go to "Study Notes" tab
2. Enter a topic: "Autism Spectrum Disorder in adolescents"
3. Select note type: "Summary"
4. Click "Generate Study Notes"
5. Download for offline studying

### 4. Compare Multiple AI Models

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Better Responses
- Be specific with your questions
- Include patient age when relevant
- Mention what aspect you want to focus on (diagnosis, treatment, assessment)
- Use the "Additional Context" section for complex cases

### For Studying
- Upload your lecture notes and textbooks
- Generate study notes on different topics
- Practice with the sample cases provided
- Use the Knowledge Base tab for quick reference

### Save Your Work
- The chat history saves during your session
- Download important responses
- Export study notes for later review

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Error initializing agent"
- Check your API key is correct
- Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Try copying the key again (no extra spaces)

### "Module not found" errors
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Make sure you're in the correct directory

### App won't open
- Check if port 8501 is already in use
- Try: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

### Slow responses
- This is normal! AI models take 10-30 seconds
- Reduce "Max Response Length" in settings
- Use only one model instead of comparing multiple

---

## üìö Sample Questions to Ask

Copy and paste these into the chat to practice:

```
What are the key differences between normal childhood worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder?
```

```
A 13-year-old shows declining grades, social withdrawal, and irritability for 2 months. What should be considered in the differential diagnosis?
```

```

```

```
Explain the CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist) and when it's most useful.
```
