## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check the Full Error Logs:

1. On Streamlit Cloud, click your app
2. Click "Manage app" (bottom right)
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for the full error message

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Wrong package name**
- Make sure it's `anthropic` not `Anthropic` (lowercase)

**Issue 2: Version conflict**
- Try removing version numbers: just `anthropic` instead of `anthropic==0.25.0`

**Issue 3: Missing file**
- Make sure `requirements.txt` is in the **root** of your repository, not in a subfolder
